# Voron 0.1 handles compatible with RatRig V-Core 3 Enclosure
These are scaled Voron 0.1 handles where the magnets have been replaced with holes for the regular M5 screws with are also being used for the rest of the build and the stock enclosure Nylon handles.

* 2x M5x20 head cap crews

I printed them with 40% infill and it should work without a brim as the model doesn't tend to warp.
 
The handles are using the same hole distance and size than the nylon handles RR ships with the enclosure.
As I don't own an enclosure yet, I used the official RR CAD data so lets hope that it matches.
