# Voron 0.1 handles compatible with RatRig V-Core 3 Enclosure

These are mostly enlarged Voron 0.1 handles.
I replaced the magnets with holes for the regular M5 screws which are used throughout the build and also made the ends a bit thicker.

Kudos to the Voron team for such a great design ( https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/tree/Voron0.1/ )

* 2x M5x20 head cap crews

I printed them with 40% infill and it should work without a brim as the model doesn't tend to warp.
 
The handles are using the same hole distance and size than the nylon handles RR ships with the enclosure.
As I don't own an enclosure yet, I used the official RR CAD data so lets hope that it matches.
