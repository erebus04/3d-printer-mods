# BTT Octopus V1.1 5015 Cooling Tunnel 
You will need

* 2x M3 Brass heatstake inserts - short M3x5x4
* 2x M3x35 BHCS (to mount the tunnel on the board)
* 2x M3x20 BHCS (to mount the 5015 on the tunnel)

All connectors should be still accessible.
If you operate your 5015 fan with 12V or PWM it, it should be nearly inaudible.

No pictures for now as my current prints are awful.
