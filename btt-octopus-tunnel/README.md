# BTT Octopus V1.1 5015 Cooling Tunnel 
You will need

* 2x M3 Brass heatstake inserts - short M3x5x4 (to mount the 5015 fan)
* 2x M3x35 BHCS (to mount the tunnel on the board)
* 2x M3x20 BHCS (to mount the 5015 on the tunnel)

It prints without supports and of course please put the flat side on the board.
I used PETG, 25% cubic infill and it's pretty difficult to bend it.
Be gentle with the insets and the M3x20 screws, there is not much plastic behind it and if you squeezed in the inserts too fast plastic may have accumulated at the bottom.

I did not try this tunnel yet with attached connectors however all of them should be still accessible.

If you care about noise, you should operate your 5015 fan with 12V or use PWM to keep it silent.

No pictures for now as my current prints are awful.
