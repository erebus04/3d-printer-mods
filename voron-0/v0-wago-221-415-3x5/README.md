# Voron V0 1515 3x Wago 221-415 Mounts
Based on the Voron V2 / 2020 mounts by Boingomw which you can find at https://github.com/boingomw/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Boingomw/Wago_mount

2x M3x6 SHCS and a M3 nut were sufficient for me.
I ordered Wago Ex instead of the regular Wagos because they're white. And they're more useful in case you printer tends to explode.
